# üîç Seek & Hunt: Malware Analysis Task 

Welcome to the **Seek & Hunt** challenge!  In this task, you'll dive deep into the world of **Malware Analysis**. This is a **combined** challenge, requiring both **Static** and **Dynamic Analysis** techniques to uncover the true nature of a malicious executable. 

As a passionate of Malwares , I created this task to give you a hands-on opportunity to **explore** how malicious software works, **analyze** its components, and understand the methods used to identify it.  By combining both static and dynamic analysis, this task aims to sharpen your skills in identifying and understanding malware in real-world scenarios.

##  What You Need to Do:

### 1. **Malware Executable**: 
You will be provided with a suspicious malware executable file. Your task is to answer the following questions about it:

   - **What is the original name of the file?**   : pdhelper.exe
     - Use **[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)** to check if the file has been previously analyzed and to understand its reputation and potential detections.
   
   - **What scripting language was used to create the malware?**  : AHK
     - Use **[AnyRun](https://any.run/)** or a similar sandbox environment to analyze the malware's behavior and try to identify the scripting language used (e.g., Python, PowerShell, etc.).

   - **Does the malware make use of any DLL files?**  : dx9_overlay.dll
     - Use **[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)** to scan any DLL files the malware may rely on and investigate their purpose and reputation.

### 2. **Dynamic Analysis**: 
   - Use tools like **AnyRun** or **Cuckoo Sandbox** to run the malware in a controlled environment. Watch closely for any suspicious network activity üåê, file manipulation üóÇÔ∏è, or system changes ‚öôÔ∏è. 

### 3. **Static Analysis**:  
   - Examine the executable **without running** it. Use tools like **PEStudio** to analyze the file‚Äôs **static properties**. Look for strings, imports, resources, and other clues that may reveal important details about the malware.
