# 🔍 Seek & Hunt: Malware Analysis Task 🦠

Welcome to the **Seek & Hunt** challenge! 🎉 In this task, you'll dive deep into the world of **Malware Analysis**. This is a **combined** challenge, requiring both **Static** and **Dynamic Analysis** techniques to uncover the true nature of a malicious executable. 🖥️⚠️

As a passionate of Malwares , I created this task to give you a hands-on opportunity to **explore** how malicious software works, **analyze** its components, and understand the methods used to identify it. 💻 By combining both static and dynamic analysis, this task aims to sharpen your skills in identifying and understanding malware in real-world scenarios.

## 🚨 What You Need to Do:

### 1. **Malware Executable**: 
You will be provided with a suspicious malware executable file. Your task is to answer the following questions about it:

   - **What is the original name of the file?** 📝  : pdhelper.exe
     - Use **[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)** to check if the file has been previously analyzed and to understand its reputation and potential detections.
   
   - **What scripting language was used to create the malware?** 💻 : AHK
     - Use **[AnyRun](https://any.run/)** or a similar sandbox environment to analyze the malware's behavior and try to identify the scripting language used (e.g., Python, PowerShell, etc.).

   - **Does the malware make use of any DLL files?** 🔍 : dx9_overlay.dll
     - Use **[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)** to scan any DLL files the malware may rely on and investigate their purpose and reputation.

### 2. **Dynamic Analysis**: 🔄  
   - Use tools like **AnyRun** or **Cuckoo Sandbox** to run the malware in a controlled environment. Watch closely for any suspicious network activity 🌐, file manipulation 🗂️, or system changes ⚙️. 

### 3. **Static Analysis**: 🧑‍💻  
   - Examine the executable **without running** it. Use tools like **PEStudio** to analyze the file’s **static properties**. Look for strings, imports, resources, and other clues that may reveal important details about the malware.

## 💡 Why This Task?

This challenge combines both **Dynamic Analysis** and **Static Analysis**. By mixing both methods, you’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of the malware. Dynamic analysis shows how the malware behaves when executed 🏃‍♂️, while static analysis lets you examine the structure and code without executing it 📜. Together, these techniques help you uncover the **full picture** of a piece of malware, including its operation, attack methods, and how to defend against it. 🛡️

I have a deep passion for **malware analysis**, and this task is my way of sharing that interest with you. 🧠💥 Malware is both fascinating and dangerous, and by studying it, we can better understand **attack techniques** and develop stronger **defensive strategies**. 🚀

## 🎯 Enjoy and Good Luck! 🍀
