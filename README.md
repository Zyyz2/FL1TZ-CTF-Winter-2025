# 🏆 FL1TZ CTF – The Ultimate Cybersecurity Challenge
Welcome to FL1TZ CTF, a competition designed to test and sharpen your hacking skills! This CTF featured a mix of categories, including Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, Forensics, OSINT, Web, Misc, Malware Analysis, Hardware, and Pwn, ensuring a challenging and exciting experience for all players.

## 🔍 Forensics & Malware Analysis – My Contribution
I had the pleasure of being the author of several Forensics challenges , the OSINT tasks and the Malware Analysis task in this CTF! From dissecting event logs to unraveling complex malware behavior, I aimed to create realistic, intense, and fun challenges that would push your investigative skills to the limit.

## 🔧 Tools You Used in Forensics
### To solve these tasks, you needed some top-tier forensic tools, including:

#### - Wireshark 🕵️‍♂️ – Analyzing network traffic and extracting valuable clues.
#### - Python 🐍 – Crafting scripts to automate forensic analysis and carve out artifacts.
#### - Docker 🐳 – Setting up remote forensic environments for controlled investigations.
#### - FTK Imager 🛠️ – Capturing and examining memory dumps for hidden traces.
#### - ANY.RUN & VirusTotal 🦠 – Sandboxing malware to study its behavior.
#### - Event Viewer 📜 – Tracing attacker actions through Windows event logs.
#### - MFT Parsers (MFT Explorer, MFTEcmd.exe by Eric Zimmermann) 💾 : Analyzing Master File Table (MFT) records to uncover deleted files, timestamps, and hidden activity.
#### - Artivive 🖼️ – A unique tool used to scan and uncover hidden clues.

## 🚀 Hope You Enjoyed My Challenges!
I put a lot of effort into designing these Forensics and Malware Analysis tasks, making them realistic, challenging, and fun. Whether you were tracing an attack through logs, reversing a malicious payload, or investigating memory artifacts, I hope you had a great time playing!
